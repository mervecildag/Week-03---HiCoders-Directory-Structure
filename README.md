# Week-03-HiCoders-Directory-Structure
when i come to terminal i first check where i am with pwd code.
After learning that I am on the desktop, I created a folder called "Hicoders" with the command ,,mkdir,, here.
I went inside the Hicoders folder with the cd command.
With the ,,mkdir,, command, I created subfolders with "Preparation" and "CSS" inside the "Hicoders" folder.
Again I checked where I was with the code ,,pwd,,.
I entered the Preperation subfolder with the code ,,cd,,
I created three subfolders named "Slides", "Resarches" and "My_notes" in the Preparation subfolder with the ,,mkdir,, command.
I checked where I was again with the ,,pwd,, command.
After learning that I was in the Preparation subfolder, I switched to the "My_notes" folder, which is the subfolder of this folder, with the command ,,cd,,.
In order to create text in the "my_notes" folder, I created a text named Lecture_01.txt by using the ,,echo ...>> ...,, command by first typing what I want to write in the text and then with which name I want to open my text.
Finally I used ,, git init ,, command to convert these CLI commands to Git commands.
